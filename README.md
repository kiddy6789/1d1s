# One Day One Story 


[![Bon-Cloud](http://www.bon-cloud.cn/assets/base/img/layout/logos/BON-Logo.png)](http://premium.bon-cloud.net/)

## The Website was customized based on Grav CMS.
___
Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based Web-platform.  There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful **Package Management System** to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.

The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Twig Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/): for powerful control of the user interface
* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [YAML](http://yaml.org): for simple configuration
* [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/): for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
* [Doctrine Cache](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.io/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/caching.html): layer for performance
* [Pimple Dependency Injection Container](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/): for extensibility and maintainability
* [Symfony Event Dispatcher](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher/introduction.html): for plugin event handling
* [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html): for CLI interface
* [Gregwar Image Library](https://github.com/Gregwar/Image): for dynamic image manipulation
